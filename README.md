# captcha_solving_with_yolo
This project, created in 2020, aims to solve captcha tasks on the website of Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior: https://www.ris.gov.tw/app/portal/3014. It utilizes the YOLOv3 model (Darknet) and is implemented in Python 3. This work was developed during my internship at Alphaloan (now Alpha Intelligence) and is being uploaded for backup purposes.
